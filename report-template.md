## Overview of the Analysis

The project objective was to develop a logistic regression model to determine the credit worthiness of a perspective loan applicant, in essence if the company offered the loan -- would the loan be classified as "healthy" or "high-risk". 
The dataset used to train the model consisted of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company and included several features -- as shown below.

The loan status column is used to distinguish between healthy (0) loans and high-risk (1) loans.  


As displayed in the summary, the original dataset was heavily imbalanced as -- 75,036 loans were classified as healthy while only 2,500 loans were classified as high-risk.  Since the original dataset was highly imbalanced I 


Given that the data in the original dataset was heavily imbalanced, the analysis compared the difference in predictive performance for two different logistic regression models. While the models were trained using different datasets, the models actually very similar as both are scikit-learn LogisticRegression Models, and use the same features to train the model.  Where the models differ relates to the data that was used to train each model.  After splitting the data into training and testing datasets:
 * model 1: trained using original imbalanced data
 * model 2: trained using randomly oversampled data -- which had the same number of healthy and high-risk loans

After the models were trained they were used to predict on the same testing data. The results of the prediction models were analzed using scikit-learn's balance_accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, and classification_report.  The results for each model are discussed in more detail in the section below

## Results
* Machine Learning Model 1: Trained on original, imbalanced data:
    * Balanced accuracy score = 0.95204792
    * Healthy-loans:
        * Precision score: 1.00 -- of all the loans the model predicted to be healthy; 100% of them were actually healthy.
        * Recall score: 0.99 -- of all the loans to actually be classified as healthy, the model predicted this outcome correctly for 99% of the loans
        * F1-score: 1.000 -- indicates that the model does a good job of predicting the loan status of healthy loans
      
    * High-Risk loans:
        * Precision score: 0.85 -- of the loans the model predicted to be high-risk; 85% of them were actually high-risk
        * Recall score: 0.91 -- signifies that out of all the loans to actually be classified as high-risk, the model predicted this outcome correctly for 91% of the loans.
        * F1-score: 0.88 -- indicates that the model does a reasonable job of predicting the loan status of high-risk loans. The drop in precision vs. recall suggests that the model slighly over-estimates how many high-risk loans there are

* Machine Learning Model 2: Trained on randomly oversampled data:
    * Balanced accuracy score: 0.99367812
    * Healthy-loans:
        * Precision score: 1.00 -- of all the loans the model predicted to be healthy; 100% of them were actually healthy.
        * Recall score: 0.99 -- of all the loans to actually be classified as healthy, the model predicted this outcome correctly for 99% of the loans
        * F1-score: 1.000 -- indicates that the model does a good job of predicting the loan status of healthy loans
      
    * High-Risk loans:
        * Precision score: 0.84 -- of the loans the model predicted to be high-risk; 84% of them were actually high-risk
        * Recall score: 0.99 -- signifies that out of all the loans to actually be classified as high-risk, the model predicted this outcome correctly for 99% of the loans.
        * F1-score: 0.91 -- indicates that the model does a reasonable job of predicting the loan status of high-risk loans. The drop in precision vs. recall suggests that the model slighly over-estimates how many high-risk loans there are

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
